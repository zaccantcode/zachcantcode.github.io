<p class="p1">Why did are you learning web development?</p>

<p class="p2">
    
    I started learning HTML and CSS about 1 year ago when I was still learning a lot of 
    programming language like python, c#, and even javascript but then I realize that 
    I'm not making any progress it's like there's too much food on my plate so I decided to focus
    on one programming language and that is javascript but then I realize that javascript is too 
    hard for my tiny brain to handle so I started learning HTML instead after two weeks of learning
    HTML I was happy with my result because I made something. For the first time, I was seeing progress so I kept on learning it.
